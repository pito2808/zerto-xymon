Purpose: these scripts monitor zerto replication

requirements: module PyYAML, theses scripts were written wih Python version 2.6.6 


FILES:
=====
file zertoevents.py: check if events are triggered or not. it will display last 24 hours events.

file zertovpgs.py: VPG health check.

file zertovms.py:  Virtual Machine replicated by Zerto health check.

file xymon.py : xymon subprograms

file zertomonitor.py: connection to zerto using zerto restful api.
                        shared subprograms

file zerto.py: main script launched by xymon.

CONFIGURATION FILES:
====================

zertoconfig.py: parse file zertoconfig.ini and should be able instance several ZVMs

file zertoconfig.ini: ZVMs parameters , use brackets as ZVM separators

file zertocustomers.py : parse and return values from configuration file zertocustomers.yaml

file zertocustomers.yaml : 
    - using YAML format so indentation count!!!!! use space not tab
    - get customized parameters or default parameters
    - for each server where zerto will be renderered currently 3 parameters can be set:
        1. WITHIN (secondes)
        analyze log event within WITHIN secondes when hobbit is launch. by default, 600 secondes.
        2. skip_vpg_check (list type)
        set VPG to skip from monitoring. Use comma to separate several VPS.
        for example: [ SWMLU_UM, SWMLU_MWS]
        3. rpo (secondes)
        set rpo threshold per server . by default rpo is 300 secondes 


HOBBIT TAG
==========

use ZERTO as a tag  then followed by NOZOG or ZOG TERM to catch vpg per customers.

NOZOG : use regex to filter VPGs which belong to a customer.
------
for instance, customer STAPLES has all VPG name started by SMW or SWM:
ZERTO:NOZOG:SMW|SWM

AGA has all VPG names  begin with with AGA:
ZERTO:NOZOG:AGA

ZOG: filter VPG per ZOG.
----

Unfornately, no ZORG was available at the time of writing this monitoring to validate the part. Do not use this tag until validation.


ZERTO:ZOG:zog_name
